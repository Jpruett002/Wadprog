        <strong>What Is A Credit Score?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A credit score is a number generated by a mathematical formula that is
        meant to predict creditworthiness. Credit scores range from 300-850. The
        higher your score is, the more likely you are to get a loan. The lower
        your score is, the less likely you are to get a loan. If you have a low
        credit score and manage to get approved for credit, your interest rate
        will be much higher than someone who had a good credit score. So, having
        a high credit score will save you many thousands of dollars.

        <strong>What Is A Credit Bureau?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A credit bureau is a company that collects and maintains your credit
        information and sells it to lenders, creditors and consumers in the form
        of a credit report. There are dozens of credit bureaus, we're most
        concerned with the big three: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion.

        The percentages in this chart show how important each of the categories
        is in determining your credit score. We will help you to remove negative
        items from your payment history. We will also show you how to maximize
        your debt ratio score, even if paying off credit cards is not an option.

        <strong>How Your Behavior Is Evaluated In Your Credit Report:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Do you pay your bills on time?</strong> Payment history is a
        major factor in credit scoring. If you have paid bills late, have
        collections or a bankruptcy, these events won't reflect well in your
        credit score.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Do you have a long credit history?</strong> Generally speaking,
        the longer your history of holding accounts is, the more trusted you
        will be as a borrower.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Have you applied for credit recently?</strong> If you have many
        recent inquiries this can be construed as being negative by the bureaus.
        Only apply for credit when you really want it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What is your outstanding debt?</strong> It is important to not
        use all of your available credit. If all of your credit cards are maxed
        out, your scores will reflect that you are not managing your debt
        wisely.
