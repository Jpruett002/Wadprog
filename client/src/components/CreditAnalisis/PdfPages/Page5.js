        <strong>Credit Score Ranges And Their Meaning</strong>
      </p>

      <p style={{ marginTop: "20px" }}>

          <strong>800 and Higher </strong>
        </span>

          (Excellent) With a credit score in this range no lender will ever
          disapprove your loan application. Additionally, the APR (Annual
          Percentage Rate) on your credit cards will be the lowest possible.
          You'll be treated as royalty. Achieving this excellent credit rating
          not only requires financial knowledge and discipline, but also a good
          credit history. Generally speaking, to achieve this excellent rating
          you must also use a substantial amount of credit on an ongoing monthly
          basis and always repay it ahead of time.

        </span>
        <span>
          {" "}
          (Very Good) 27% of the United States population belongs to this credit
          score range. With this credit score range, you will enjoy good rates
          and approved for nearly any type of credit loan or personal loan,
          whether unsecured or secured.
        </span>
      </p>

      <p style={{ marginTop: "20px" }}>
        <span>
          <strong>680 - 699 </strong>
        </span>
        <span>
          {" "}
          (Good) This range is the average credit score. In this range approvals
          are practically guaranteed but the interest rates might be marginally
          higher. If you're thinking about a long term loan such as a mortgage,
          try working to increase your credit score higher than 720 and you will
          be rewarded for your efforts; your long term savings will be
          noticeable.

      <p style={{ marginTop: "20px" }}>
        <span>
          <strong>620 - 679 </strong>
        </span>
        <span>
          {" "}
          (OK or Fair) Depending on what kind of loan or credit you are applying
          for and your credit history, you might find that the rates you are
          quoted aren't best. That doesn't mean that you won't be approved but,
          certain restrictions will apply to the loan's terms.
        </span>
      </p>

      <p style={{ marginTop: "20px" }}>
        <span>
          <strong>580 - 619 </strong>
        </span>
        <span>
          {" "}
          (Poor) With a poor credit rating you can still get an unsecured
          personal loan and even a mortgage, but the terms and interest rates
          won't be very appealing. You'll be required to pay more over a longer
          period of time because of the high interest rates.
        </span>
      </p>

      <p style={{ marginTop: "20px" }}>
        <span>
          <strong>500 - 579 </strong>
        </span>
        <span>
          {" "}
          (Bad) With a score in this range you can get a loan but nothing even
          close to what you expect it to be. Some people with bad credit apply
          for loans to consolidate debt in search for a fresh start. However, if
          you decide to do that proceed cautiously. With a 500 credit score you
          need to make sure that you don't default on payments or you'll be
          making your situation worse and might head towards bankruptcy, which
          is not what you want.
        </span>

      <p style={{ marginTop: "20px" }}>
        <span>
          <strong>499 and Lower </strong>
        </span>
        <span>
          {" "}
          (Very Bad) If this is your score range you need serious assistance
          with how you handle your credit. You're making too many credit
          blunders and they will only get worse if you don't take positive
          action. If you are thinking of a loan (which won't be easy), the rates
          will be very high and the terms will be very strict. We recommend that
          you fix your credit first before applying for a loan.
