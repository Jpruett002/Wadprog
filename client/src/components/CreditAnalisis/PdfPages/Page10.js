        <strong>This Process Takes Time</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember, it has taken you years to get your credit into its current
        state, so cleaning it up will not happen overnight. We cannot dispute
        everything all at once, or the credit bureaus will reject the disputes
        by marking them as "frivolous," so we must do this carefully and
        strategically. It takes 30 to 45 days for bureaus and creditors to
        respond to each letter, and even more time for changes to reflect on
        your reports. A difficult item may take multiple letters to multiple
        parties, so patience is key. Thanks to technology (and by logging into
        our client portal), you'll receive real-time updates of the work we're
        doing every step of the way.

      <p>
        By following our program and our advice, your credit will improve -- and
        along the way, we'll teach you how to maintain your excellent credit
        long after our work is done.
