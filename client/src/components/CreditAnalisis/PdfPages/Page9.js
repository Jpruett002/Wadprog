          Provide a copy of your Photo ID and a copy of the top section of a
          recent utility bill (or an insurance statement or some other bill) as
          proof of your current address to include with our letters to the
          credit bureaus. Take a picture of these on your phone and upload them

        <strong>How You Can Speed Up The Process</strong>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Stop applying for credit (Each time you do it lowers your scores.)
        </li>
        <li>Do not close any accounts (This also lowers your score.)</li>
        <li>
          Pay your credit cards down to below 25% of the available credit line.
          This will make a huge positive impact on your credit score.
        </li>
        <li>
          Never spend more than 25% of the available credit line, even if you
          pay the balance off in full each month.
        </li>
        <li>
          . Pay your bills on time! One missed payment will lower your score
          dramatically and undo all the work we are doing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep your credit monitoring account active throughout the credit
          repair process, so we can see the changes to your accounts and scores.
          Your score won't suffer if you're ordering your own reports. Be sure
          to let us know your login details to the credit monitoring account.
          You can add those in your client portal.
